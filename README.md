# Brain-Age Estimation Pipeline  

This repository provides a ready-to-run pipeline for estimating "brain age" from neuroimaging-derived features. The pipeline is organized into several components to streamline data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and training.  

## Directory structure  
- `data/` – contains the input CSV data. A small `sample_data.csv` is provided for demonstration.  
- `models/` – stores trained model files generated by the training script.  
- `scripts/` – contains the Python scripts for data loading, preprocessing, model definition, and training.  

## Setup  
1. Install Python 3.8 or later.  
2. Install required packages using pip:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## Usage  
1. Place your dataset in CSV format under the `data/` directory or use the provided `data/sample_data.csv`. The CSV should have feature columns and a target column named `brain_age`.  
2. Run the training script from the repository root:  
   ```bash  
   python scripts/train.py --data_path data/sample_data.csv  
   ```  
   The script will load the data, perform basic preprocessing (feature scaling), train a baseline model (linear regression), evaluate it on a hold-out test set, and save the trained model to `models/model.pkl`.  

## Extending the pipeline  
- Modify `scripts/data_loader.py` to customize how data are loaded or add support for additional file formats.  
- Adjust preprocessing steps in `scripts/data_loader.py` as needed (e.g., add normalization or feature engineering).  
- Replace or extend the baseline model in `scripts/baseline_model.py` with more advanced algorithms such as random forests or neural networks.  

## Example  
To try the pipeline with the included sample dataset, run:  
```bash  
python scripts/train.py --data_path data/sample_data.csv  
```  
The output will display the mean absolute error (MAE) on the test set and store the trained model in the `models/` directory.
